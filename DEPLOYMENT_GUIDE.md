### 2. Deploy to Render

1. **Sign up for Render**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)

   - Select "Web Service"

3. **Connect Your Repository**
   - If first time: Click "Connect GitHub" and authorize Render
   - Find and select your `weekend-trunk-shifts` repository
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Configure Service**
   
   Render should auto-detect settings from `render.yaml`, but verify:
   
   - **Name**: `weekend-trunk-shifts` (or your preference)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Runtime**: Python 3
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Plan**: Free

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait 2-4 minutes for deployment
   - You'll see build logs in real-time

6. **Access Your App**
   - Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://weekend-trunk-shifts.onrender.com`
   - Click the URL to test your application
   - Login with: `admin` / `admin123`

### 3. Share With Your Team

Send an email to employees with:

```
Subject: Weekend Trunk Shift Preferences - Action Required

Hi team,

Please submit your weekend shift preferences by [DEADLINE] using this link:
https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com

Login Instructions:
- Username: [your assigned username, e.g., employee1]
- Password: password

What to do:
1. Rank your general shift type preferences (Saturday, Sunday morning, Sunday evening)
2. Select your top 12 preferred specific shifts
3. Select your bottom 6 least wanted shifts
4. Click Submit

You'll be assigned 2 shifts over the 20-week period. Shifts on the same weekend won't be assigned together.

Questions? Contact [YOUR NAME]
```

### 4. Managing the Schedule

**As Manager:**

1. **Monitor Submissions**
   - Log in regularly to see who has submitted
   - URL: `https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com`
   - Credentials: `admin` / `admin123`

2. **Set Deadline**
   - Use the deadline picker on manager dashboard
   - Click "Update Deadline"

3. **Run Allocation**
   - Once all 30 employees have submitted
   - Click "Run Allocation Algorithm"
   - Check browser console (F12) for detailed logs

4. **Export Results**
   - Click "Export to Excel" for distribution
   - Click "Download Backup" to save JSON data

5. **Important: Download Backup Before App Sleeps**
   - Free tier apps sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - Data persists during sleep
   - BUT: Data is ephemeral and could be lost on restart
   - Always download backup after allocation!

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Problem: App shows "Not Found" or error page**
- Solution: Check Render dashboard for build errors
- Look at "Logs" tab for error messages

**Problem: App is slow to load**
- Cause: Free tier apps "sleep" after 15 min inactivity
- Solution: First request takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- This is normal on free tier

**Problem: Data disappeared**
- Cause: Render free tier uses ephemeral storage
- Solution: Use "Download Backup" button regularly
- Consider upgrading to paid tier with persistent disk

**Problem: Can't connect GitHub repository**
- Solution: Make sure repository is not private, or grant Render access to private repos

**Problem: Build fails**
- Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Look at build logs in Render dashboard

### 6. Updating the App

When you need to make changes:

1. **Edit files locally**
2. **Commit and push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```
3. **Render auto-deploys** - Your app will automatically redeploy with changes

### 7. Cost Considerations

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 750 hours/month runtime (plenty for this use)
- Apps sleep after 15 min inactivity
- Ephemeral storage (data resets on restart)
- HTTP/2 and HTTPS included

**When to Upgrade:**
- Need persistent storage: $7/month (includes PostgreSQL)
- Need always-on service: $7/month
- High traffic: May need more resources

For a 1-2 week preference collection period, **free tier is perfect**.

### 8. Best Practices

**Before Collection Period:**
- Test the app thoroughly
- Set the deadline date
- Send clear instructions to employees

**During Collection Period:**
- Check dashboard daily for submissions
- Download backup every few days
- Keep the app active (visit URL daily to prevent sleep)

**After Allocation:**
- Export Excel immediately
- Download JSON backup
- Distribute schedule to team
- Can delete Render service or let it sleep

### 9. Security Notes

**Current Setup:**
- Simple username/password authentication
- Fixed passwords for employees (`password`)
- Admin password (`admin123`)
- HTTPS encryption by default

**For Production:**
- Change passwords in `app.py` before deploying
- Consider more secure password generation
- Or keep current setup if your team is comfortable
