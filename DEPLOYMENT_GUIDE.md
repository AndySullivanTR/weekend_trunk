   - If first time: Click "Connect GitHub" and authorize Render
   - Find and select your `weekend-trunk-shifts` repository
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Configure Service**
   
   Render should auto-detect settings from `render.yaml`, but verify:
   
   - **Name**: `weekend-trunk-shifts` (or your preference)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Runtime**: Python 3
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Plan**: Starter (required for persistent storage)
   - **Disk**: Verify 1GB disk is configured for `/opt/render/project/src/data`

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait 2-4 minutes for deployment
   - You'll see build logs in real-time

6. **Access Your App**
   - Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://weekend-trunk-shifts.onrender.com`
   - Click the URL to test your application
   - Login with: `admin` / `admin123`

### 3. Share With Your Team

Send an email to employees with:

```
Subject: Weekend Trunk Shift Preferences - Action Required

Hi team,

Please submit your weekend shift preferences by [DEADLINE] using this link:
https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com

Login Instructions:
- Username: [your assigned username, e.g., employee1]
- Password: password

What to do:
1. Rank your general shift type preferences (Saturday, Sunday morning, Sunday evening)
2. Select your top 12 preferred specific shifts
3. Select your bottom 6 least wanted shifts
4. Click Submit

You'll be assigned 2 shifts over the 20-week period. Shifts on the same weekend won't be assigned together.

Questions? Contact [YOUR NAME]
```

### 4. Managing the Schedule

**As Manager:**

1. **Monitor Submissions**
   - Log in regularly to see who has submitted
   - URL: `https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com`
   - Credentials: `admin` / `admin123`

2. **Set Deadline**
   - Use the deadline picker on manager dashboard
   - Click "Update Deadline"

3. **Run Allocation**
   - Once all 30 employees have submitted
   - Click "Run Allocation Algorithm"
   - Check browser console (F12) for detailed logs

4. **Export Results**
   - Click "Export to Excel" for distribution
   - Click "Download Backup" to save JSON data

5. **Data Persistence**
   - This app uses persistent disk storage (1GB mounted at `/data`)
   - All preferences, assignments, and settings survive restarts and deployments
   - Automatic backups are created in `/data/backups/` (keeps last 30)
   - Manual backups can be downloaded via `/api/backup` endpoint
   - Recommended: Download backup after allocation for extra safety

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Problem: App shows "Not Found" or error page**
- Solution: Check Render dashboard for build errors
- Look at "Logs" tab for error messages

**Problem: App is slow to load**
- Cause: Starter plan apps may spin down after inactivity
- Solution: First request after inactivity takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- This is normal behavior for cost efficiency

**Problem: Data disappeared**
- This should NOT happen with persistent disk configured
- Check Render dashboard to verify disk is mounted
- Check `/data/backups/` folder for automatic backups
- If issue persists, contact Render support

**Problem: Can't connect GitHub repository**
- Solution: Make sure repository is not private, or grant Render access to private repos

**Problem: Build fails**
- Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Look at build logs in Render dashboard

### 6. Updating the App

When you need to make changes:

1. **Edit files locally**
2. **Commit and push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```
3. **Render auto-deploys** - Your app will automatically redeploy with changes

### 7. Cost Considerations

**Current Configuration: Starter Plan ($7/month)**
- Includes persistent disk storage (1GB)
- HTTP/2 and HTTPS included
- App may spin down after inactivity (not always-on)
- Sufficient for 30 trunk writers and preference collection

**What You're Getting:**
- ✅ Persistent storage - data survives restarts
- ✅ Automatic backups stored on disk
- ✅ Professional HTTPS endpoint
- ✅ Auto-deployment from GitHub

**If You Need More:**
- Always-on service: Upgrade to Standard plan ($25/month)
- More storage: Can add additional disk space
- High traffic/performance: Standard or Pro plans

**Cost vs Benefit:**
For a multi-week preference collection period managing 30 trunk writers, the **Starter plan ($7/month) is appropriate and cost-effective**.

### 8. Best Practices

**Before Collection Period:**
- Test the app thoroughly
- Set the deadline date
- Send clear instructions to employees

**During Collection Period:**
- Check dashboard daily for submissions
- Data is automatically backed up after each preference submission
- App may spin down after inactivity, but data persists
- Optional: Download manual backup weekly for extra security

**After Allocation:**
- Export Excel immediately
- Download JSON backup
- Distribute schedule to team
- Can delete Render service or let it sleep

### 9. Security Notes

**Current Setup:**
- Simple username/password authentication
- Fixed passwords for employees (`password`)
- Admin password (`admin123`)
- HTTPS encryption by default

**For Production:**
- Change passwords in `app.py` before deploying
- Consider more secure password generation
- Or keep current setup if your team is comfortable
